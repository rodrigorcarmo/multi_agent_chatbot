This repository contains the notebooks used to create a multi-agent system using LLMs (Large Language Models) combined with Langchain and Langgraph.

---

It is structured as follows:

* `ai_collab_langgraph.ipynb`: Contains the multi-agent system
* `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Contains the classifier to perform the sentiment analysis using Scikit-Learn
* `summarization.ipynb`: Contains the fine tuning of the `t5-small` to perform the summarization task

All the development was made on Google Colab and a HuggingFace API Key is required in order to proper execute the code.
